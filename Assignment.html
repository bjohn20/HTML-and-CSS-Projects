    <p>Here is a quote from The Daily Motivator website:</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://greatday.com/motivate/231007.html">
      Commit with action<br /><br />
      Wishes, plans, and promises have a common deficiency. They all lack
      meaningful commitment. Commitment begins when you take action. The most
      impressive words, the most detailed strategies have little meaning until
      they’re acted upon. Are you not quite ready to begin? Begin anyway,
      initiate genuine commitment, and you’ll quickly be making progress and
      will forget about whether you were ready or not. You can always learn and
      adjust as you go, but it doesn’t work the other way around. You never make
      progress if all you’re doing is learning, preparing, and revising your
      plans. Give your intentions the action they deserve. Implement your plans,
      go where they lead, and you’ll invoke the power of commitment. If you wish
      you could, if you think you can, begin it. Commit with action and make it
      happen. — Ralph Marston
